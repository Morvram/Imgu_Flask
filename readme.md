README FOR CS50's FINAL PROJECT

The flask app attached, which I have titled ImguFlask, is an image-manipulation app which allows users to upload images, apply filters to them, and store them in a personal library while keeping statistics about the user's use of the site. ImguFlask uses the Imgur API to upload and host the images, and the Pillow library to apply manipulations to the images themselves. The CS50 library's SQL module is also used for controlling the app's database.

This app was created over a period of several weeks by Joshua Mandell, and is a one-person project. Along the way I learned to interact with and use APIs (practicing my API calls in Postman before writing code using the Requests library in Python), to understand image manipulation as implemented by the Pillow library, and to design my website's layout using bootstrap and elements borrowed from the "Finance" problem set completed earlire in the Web track.
